# File Organizer

A simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that helps you organize files in a selected folder by categorizing them into subfolders based on file types.

## Features

- Organizes files into categories such as:
  - Documents (`.pdf`, `.docx`, `.txt`, `.xlsx`)
  - Images (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.gif`)
  - Videos (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.avi`)
  - Music (`.mp3`, `.wav`)
  - Archives (`.zip`, `.rar`, `.7z`)
  - Others (for uncategorized file types)
- Simple, intuitive GUI using Tkinter
- Automatically creates folders for each category if they donâ€™t already exist

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system

Navigate to the project directory:
                                  cd file-organizer

- Usage
1)Run the script:
                 python file_organizer.py

- In the GUI window:
                 Click the "Browse Folder" button.

Select the folder you want to organize.

The program will sort files into corresponding category folders.

- How It Works:

 The script scans all files in the selected folder, checks their extensions, and moves them into folders named:

.Documents

.Images

.Videos

.Music

.Archives

.Others (for anything not in the above categories)
